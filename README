This repo contains various hacks, kludges, and hairy stuff for
Symbolics Genera - specifically Symbolics Open Genera running on a
Virtual Lisp Machine.

The majority of this code will not have a copyright or license
attributed to it, therefore imagine the MIT license attached to each
and every file.

If any of this code is useful for anyone, then feel free to let me
know and by all means send me improvements, or even just send me your
lispm-init.

Please note that most of these files were written in Zmacs and will
probably have odd formatting that will look strange when viewed by
anything else.
